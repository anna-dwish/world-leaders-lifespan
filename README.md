# Introduction
The purpose of this project is to explore the lifespan of leaders beyond their terms of service. Some factors we intend to better understand include how type of leadership (a Pope vs a Chinese Emperor, for example) and century affect this response.

# Motivation
We were motivated to explore this after comparing the lifespans of popes from the explorations accomplished in "A Bayesian Survival Analysis of a Historical Dataset: How Long Do Popes Live?" (Stander, Valle, Cortina-Borja). We wanted to better understand the lifespans of other types of leaders."
