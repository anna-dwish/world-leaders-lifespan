# Introduction 

In an investigation of the post-election survival times of popes, Stander et al. (2018) highlighted predictive results from Bayesian analysis and urged researchers to consider other world leaders in their approach to understand survival analysis more critically. Our study extends this work by analyzing the survival times of 177 world leaders. These include Roman Catholic Popes, United States Presidents, Chinese Emperors, Japanese Emperors, and Dalai Lamas from 1325 to current day. 

In this paper, we discuss a Weibull distribution modelling the lifespan of world leaders. We  determine how year of birth and type of leadership are related to a leader’s lifespan, and if the relationship between year of birth and lifespan is dependent on the type of leadership. In addition, we will provide point and interval predictions of the lifespans of living leaders in our data as well as use their predictive distributions to make comparitive statements. 

# Data 

To address the above research objectives, we analyzed data on the life expectancy of 177 world leaders. Leaders in this dataset range from Pope Gregory XII, born in 1325, to President Obama, born in 1961. Life expectancy was defined to be either the leader’s current age, if alive, or age of death, if deceased. The 10 leaders in the dataset that are currently alive are considered right censored observations -- that is, we cannot know their exact age of death, but do know their current lifespan. 

Covariates of interest in this study are *type* and *time*. Type is categorical variable corresponding to the 5 varieties of world leader. Of the type levels, Popes are the most represented in the dataset with 63 observations. In contrast, Dalai Lamas comprise the smallest group, with only 14 instances. The time covariate represents the leader’s year of birth, measured as the number of centuries since 1300. For example, as Pope Francis was born roughly 637 years after January 1, 1300, his time value is represented as 6.37. We opted for this shifted and scaled version of birth year in order to prevent larger year values (1961, for example) from skewing estimates. 

Below we will present some preliminary visualizations regarding our covariates of interest and survival outcome. In these visualizations, we use the term **transformed birth year** to refer to the time covariate, in order to provide a more intuitive understanding.  First, we will look at the distribution of lifespan across the 177 world leaders. 



## Distributions of Lifespan

```{r}
ggplot(leaders, aes(x=Age.Event)) + 
  geom_histogram(color="black", fill="white", bins = 10) + 
  labs(title="Distribution of Lifespan") + xlab("Lifespan (yrs)") + geom_vline(xintercept = median(leaders$Age.Event), color = "red") + annotate(geom = "text", x = 83, y = 45, label = "median: 67.5")
```

We see that lifespan follows a left skewed distribution with a median value of 67.5 (indicated in red). Next, we will look at box plot distributions of transformed birth year by leadership type. 

## Distribution of Transformed Birth Year by Leadership Type
```{r}
boxplot(time ~ Type, data = leaders, main="Distribution of Transformed Birth Year by Type of Leader", ylab="Transformed Birth Year", xlab="Leader Type")
```

Among the Chinese Emperors, Japanese Emperors, and Dalai Lamas, the interquartile ranges of median lifespan largely overlap. As can be seen, popes and U.S. presidents appear to have a slightly higher median lifespan relative to Chinese Emperors, and Dalai Lamas. Finally, we will examine the relationship between lifespan and birth year for each type of leadership.

## Interaction Plot
```{r}
ggplot(leaders, aes(x=time, y=Age.Event, shape=Type, color=Type)) +
  geom_point() + labs(title="Lifespan vs Transformed Birth Year") + 
  ylab("Lifespan (yrs)") + xlab("Transformed Birth Year") +geom_smooth(method = "lm", se=FALSE)
```

It appears as though lifespan over time has increased at similar rates across Chinese Emperors, Japanese Emperors, US Presidents, and Popes. However, for the Dalai Lamas, the plot indicates that lifespan has decreased over time. This unexpected trend can be attributed to the untimely demise of several Dalai Lamas in the 19th and 20th centuries, with causes of death ranging from common illnesses to ceiling collapses [1] . 

# Methodology

## Model Selection 

We propose a Weibull distribution to model the life expectancy $T_i$ of the $i$th leader. The first parameter $r > 0$ of the Weibull distribution is a positive scale parameter, and is constant across all leaders. We then take the log of the second parameter, $mu_i > 0$, as a linear function of the covariates.

Our proposed model is as follows: 

$$
\begin{aligned}
T_i \sim & \,Weibull(r, \mu_i)  \\
log(\mu_i) = \beta_0 + \beta_1(time_i) + \sum_{j=2}^{5} \beta_{2j} & (I(Type_i = t_j)) + \sum_{j=2}^{5}  \beta_{3j}(time_i * I(Type_i = t_j)), &(1.1)
\end{aligned}
$$


where $i$ corresponds to each world leader, and for each leader $i$, $T_i$ refers to their life expectancy, $time_i$ is the number of hundreds of years since 1300 that each leader was born, $Type_i$ refers to their leadership type, with $t = (2, 3, 4, 5)$ where 2=Chinese Emperor, 3=Dalai Lama, 4=Japanese Emperor, and 5=US President. The reference level was set to be Pope, because it is the largest category ($n=63$).

$\beta_0$ corresponds with the intercept, $\beta_1$ is the coefficient corresponding to `Time`, and for $j \in (1, 2, 3, 4, 5)$, $\beta_{2j}$ is the coefficient corresponding to the respective leadership type, and $\beta_{3j}$ is the coefficient corresponding to the interaction between `Time` and the respective leadership type.

## Choice of Prior Distributions

In our initial model, we adopted the following prior distributions for $r, \beta_1, \beta_{2j}$ and $\beta_{3j}$: 

$$
\begin{aligned}
&r \sim  \Gamma(25, 0.2)\\ 
\beta_0, \beta_1, &\beta_{2j}, \beta_{3j} \sim N(0, 100)
\end{aligned}
$$
for $j \in(1,2,3,4,5)$. 
These are informative priors (some other explanation). We consider other choices of prior distributions, which is discussed in Section ___. 

## Model Validation

We fit our initial model on the data to obtain posterior values for our parameters $r ,\beta_0, \beta_1, \beta_{2j}$ and $\beta_{3j}$. We perform  model diagnostics to ensure our parameter values have convereged, which suggested that 200,000 simulated values were sufficient. Finally, we performed sensitivity analysis.

post_summary_df %>% 
  mutate(mean = ifelse((mean == 0 & sd == 0), "(Reference)", mean),
         sd = ifelse((mean == "(Reference)" & sd == 0),"", sd),
         `95% CI` = ifelse((mean == "(Reference)" & sd == ""), "", `95% CI`)#,
         #Rhat = ifelse((mean == "(Reference)" & sd == ""), "", Rhat)
  ) %>% 
  kableExtra::kbl(booktabs = T, caption = "Parameters obtained with Model 1.1, with 95\\% Credible Intervals (CI)",
                  col.names = c("Parameter", "Mean", "Std. Dev.", "95% CI"#, "Rhat"

  #kable_styling(font_size = 10) %>% 
  
  pack_rows("Type", 4,8) %>%

```

Using JAGS, we run Model 1.1 with 150,000 simulations to determine the posterior density $\pi(r, \beta_0, \beta_1, \beta_{2j}, \beta_{3j}\, | \,data)$, with results summarized in Table 1. The 95% credible interval is created using the 2.5%  and 97.5% quantiles.

## Model Diagnostics 

We perform several model diagnostics to assess model integrity. Traceplots and $\hat{R}$[1] (maybe add source for GElman and Rubin) suggest that the chains for each parameter have converged and mix well, and autocorrelation plots indicate a low correlation between the simulations. (maybe include plots, maybe not)
